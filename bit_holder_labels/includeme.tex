%Here is how tex computes the glue g between the boxes within a vbox: (in normal usage, the boxes within a vbox are lines of text)
% let w = ((natural size of baselineskip) - depth of the preceeding hbox - height of the next hbox) plus (stretchability of \baselineskip) minus (shrinkability of \baselineskip)
% If (natural size of w) >= \lineskiplimit, then set g=w;
% else, set g=\lineskip;
% If \lineskiplimit is the greater (or equal) of the two, then we set the interline glue to \glue.
% 
%I want to manually insert glue between lines.  This means, I want Tex to always arrive at g=(0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt).
% In order to force this to happen, I set \lineskip=(0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt) and I set 
% \lineskiplimit and \baselineskip such that, for all (depth of preceeding hbox plus height of next hbox) values in the list of hboxes, we have 
%((natural size of \baselineskip) - (depth+height)) < \lineskiplimit.  
% In other words, we want to set  \lineskiplimit and \baselineskip so that
% ((natural size of \baselineskip) - \lineskiplimit) < (depth+height), for all (depth+height) values in the list.
% WE will do this by having (natural size of \baselineskip) - \lineskiplimit << 0
% i.e.  (natural size of \baselineskip) << \lineskiplimit.
% in practice, we will achieve this by setting \baselineskip=0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt
% and setting \lineskiplimit to some outrageously large, positive value, say  \lineskiplimit=100in;
\baselineskip=0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt%
\lineskiplimit=100in%
\lineskip=0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt%
